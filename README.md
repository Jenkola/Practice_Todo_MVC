# Practice_Todo_MVC
I'm just learning GIT whilst creating JS todoMVC type app.

Move along, nothing interesting here!!

# File Structure

  -App usable within index.html
  -Core JS all within js/todo_mvc.js
  -Utilises the following frameworks:
  	libs/handlebars-v4.0.js   (http://handlebarsjs.com/)
  	libs/jquery-3.2.1.js      (http://jquery.com/)
